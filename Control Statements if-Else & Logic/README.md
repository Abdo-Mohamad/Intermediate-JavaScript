So we have a love score here and we know that we get a number between 1 to 100.

So that will be the condition that we will test.

So we will say if, which is the keyword here, and then we'll open up some parentheses to add our testing

condition.

So let's say that our condition was that loveScore is equal to 100.

And in order to test for equality we're using three equal signs.

And if that is true then this block of code will be executed,

but if it's not true, i.e. else, then this block of code will be executed instead.

So let's say that, if loveScore was equal to 100.

Well that's pretty crazy, right?

Then we should say something like, alert "Your love score is this amount..."

And then we should give them an interpretation.

Like, for example, "You love each other like Kanye loves Kanye."

But otherwise, we just give them the plain old normal message where we tell them their love score.

Now some might have realized that I would have to go through this many many times until I happened to

get a love score that is 100, which is quite unlikely.

I mean it's 1 percent likely, right?

So what if we simply wanted to test for a range, say for example if the love score was between 70 and

100, or if the love score was between 0 and 30?

Well, in order to do that, then we would have to use something like greater than.

So if love score was greater than 70 then we should get this alert,

and otherwise we get this simple one instead.

So let's try this out and we get 58 on the first go.

There we go.

So we finally got above 70.

We've got 76 percent.

And we get told that we love each other like Kanye loves Kanye.
