So I want you, as a challenge, to create a love calculator.

So it should have two prompts that ask for the names of the two people, and then it should be able to

completely ignore that and then calculate a random number that is a percentage.

So your random number generator should generate a number between 1 and 100.

And finally you should give this information back to the user in the form of an alert telling them what

is their love score.
